    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p class="description"> My name is Alexandra Nwigwe and I'm a rising sophomore at Massachussetts Institute 
        of Technology. I'm studying electrical engineering and computer science with a minor in architecture. 
        I've always loved working on projects that incorporate design, hardware, and code. Because of this, 
        when on campus, you can often find me in a Makerspace or similar workshop of the sort! 
        In my free time, I enjoy dancing and amateur choreographing, writing short stories, poetry, and
        unfinished novels, and reading all of the aforemntioned (maybe finished novels instead, though), 
        causing chaos in the kitchen either by cooking or baking, playing volleyball, graphic design, 
        and just working on various art projects.
